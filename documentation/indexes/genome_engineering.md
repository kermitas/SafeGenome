#[Genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) and/or [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering) use cases

This work-in-progress index was created for "[What gives us genetic engineering and synthetic genomics?](http://scalaakka.blogspot.com/2016/05/what-we-can-do-with-our-genome.html)" blog post which is a part of [SafeGenome idea](http://scalaakka.blogspot.com/search/label/SafeGenome).
